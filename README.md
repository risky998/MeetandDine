# MeetandDine

An app to connect Cornell students and ensure that no one has to eat dinner alone. 

This app allows users to register and create a profile that gives a brief background on themselves. They can then create dinner events for others to join, or can browse through the existing dinner events and choose one that they would like to join. Viewing a user's profile would give a list of dinner events that they are attending and are hosting and viewing a dinner event would give an overview of the attendees.
